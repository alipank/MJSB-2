This project is currently not related(sync ? connected ?) to MJSB2 site project.

i create this server to sort all sewing machine that my parents had. they actually have some machine ready to be sold / promoted but they lost it in the waves of sewing machine.

the idea is to create an id sticker for each machine that has a qr code that point to the url or its id (if you implement the qr scan in your site not native camera app or glens). the sticker will also have its id in text (and maybe its machine model )

breh.
