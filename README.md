a monorepo for MJSB-2 Project.

- inventory-frontend = admin dashboard using next js for interfacing with inventory-server api
- inventory-server = api for inventory
- site-landing-page = a nextjs project but i only use its frontend (static site) for... ye landing page, i use nextjs "static" because 
    - i will deploy it to firebase, free plan ofc
    - i have no money to pay for a paid server
    - i don't think it's easy to maintain a web server (safely?)
    - i don't want to risk my shared router (with my neighbour) to open it to incoming request
    - i'm stupid

that inventory project will deployed locally.
